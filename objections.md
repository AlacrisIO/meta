# Against Legicash

Most relevant objections to Legicash, and answers to them.

## General

### It's a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are falling in value. Why invest?

While prices are volatile and there was a local bubble that deflated,
the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies remains one of growth,
because central bank currencies keep betraying users:
Cyprus, India, Venezuela, Zimbabwe... who's next?

But Legicash is not just about currency itself, but also about a platform for fast payment,
and eventually for smart contracts that can bind blockchains together.

## Competition

### Won't the Lightning Network, Raiden, etc. solve the issue for Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.?

No, the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, and Raiden for Ethereum, rely on the limited-purpose
notion of channels, that require all participants to remain online all the time
(or at least regularly) and/or (if there are only two) to make relatively frequent
updates to the main blockchain to commit the current balance.
At the cost of extreme complexity, they can conceivably increase the throughput by one
factor of magnitude, but probably not by the 3 orders of magnitude required
to compete with the speed of Credit Card processing.
This also means they remain quite expensive.

### Won't new networks like Nano, IOTA, Zilliqa, etc., provide fast and secure transactions?

No. IOTA, Nano, Zilliqa, OmniLedger, etc., are typical examples of technologies developed
by computer scientists and software engineers who don't really understand
either Economics or Security --- in one word, Game Theory.
When you look in detail at their designs, they are either not actually fast,
or not actually secure, or not actually decentralized.
Often, they're doing bad compromises between the three,
that are not even well understood by the authors.

### Why won't Ethereum or Cardano copy us and do better with more funds?

Ethereum is the first entrant and current leader in Smart Contract technology.
The Grigore Rosu's K Framework team has been doing an amazing job at formalizing
Ethereum smart contracts.
The Ethereum team is driven, and its leaders and members have consistently been
innovative with a vision that emcompasses both technological and economic
aspects of cryptocurrencies.
On the other hand, as an organization, they seem to remain amateurs and somewhat disorganized.
They also can be our best partners, and if we manage to raise money,
we can probably strike a deal with them.

Cardano is definitely the competitor that most worry me:
while I haven't seen any great innovative vision behind their products,
I am impressed by the professionalism they put in everything they do:
nothing radically new, but everything done radically better than competition.
If they take our idea and fly with it, they will definitely be a competitor to fear.
Or maybe they can become our best partner, though I don't see with what angle
we could strike a deal with them.

## Technology

### Won't querying the Gossip network be just as slow as waiting for the Consensus?

SOME transactions MUST wait for the consensus, and no one can help them.
Selling a house? A diamond? Exchanging cash? Don't accept fast confirmations.

Selling products or services to a physical person: the person is probably not double-spending
at the same second in another place, much less multi-spending a thousand times.
Plus you can easily run after them.
Selling physical goods online? Confirm to user immediately,
but don't actually deliver before confirmation.

For certain transactions, and when the payment processors is not otherwise trusted,
it is indeed better to wait for at least one round of the Consensus.


## Economics

### Will the market for cryptographic transfer fees remain at billion dollars per year, and why would you capture a sizeable chunk of it? Nano promises no fees!

Yes, this market will probably grow in the coming years.
TODO: explain.

Yes, as first entrant, we can grab a big share of the network in which we launch.
TODO: evaluations for old coin vs new coin.

### If you aim at replacing credit cards or penetrating markets they do not cover, how will you finance the merchant and customer infrastructure? Is a safe USB key (e.g. Trezor) both cheap enough and usable enough for an indian farmer to use? How do trust terminals?

## New Coin vs Old Coin

### Issues with a New Coin

(If launching our new shitcoin, e.g. Legicash.)
Why would people use yet another shitcoin?
The market will soon call for consolidation, and
a new coin is probably not going to make it big.

TODO: Solution: the market isn't consolidating *yet*, and
we're bringing a real solution to a pressing problem
for which no one else currently has any good answers.

### Issues with an Old Coin

(If on top of existing coin, e.g. Ethereum.)
How are the investors going to get their money back?
Must they buy a bunch of ethers *in addition to* already shovelling $50M at us?

TODO: Solution: convince stakeholders to pay you,
and/or buy a stake before you announce that you're going to add Legicash technology to it.

## Regulatory issues

### Issues for Payment Processors without KYC/AML

(If no KYC/AML)
USG may or may not decide that what we call a "payment processor" by analogy
counts as a payment processor and therefore needs to get a license and follow KYC/AML regulations.
Not only would payment processors running in the US might be constrained,
this might lead to the regulatory pressure on the entire network, too.

TODO: Solution: don't call our thing "payment processor",
it's only an analogy that shouldn't be taken too far.
Just like our Consensus is not a Court of Law, our notaries are not legal notaries, etc.
Also, if we use an existing established network, we can't be said to *introduce* an issue.
We just make the existing system, with its existing issues, fast.

### Issues for Payment Processors with KYC/AML

(If yes KYC/AML)
Won't cryptocurrency users object to using it?
[NB: They don't HAVE to use a payment processor, or they can be their own,
it will just be slower and more expensive. --- But then USG might demand we fork them away???]

TODO: Solution:
Even if *we* are constrained, this opens to us big markets of official money
that will be closed to more black market processors.

## Execution

### Budget

You say that the initial variant of Legicash can be launched in one year under $20M.
What the hell makes you say that???

TODO: complete plan.md and refer to it.

### Talent

Can you hire the talent necessary to complete this task?

TODO: explain
