The Competitive Landscape
=========================


Plasma
------


Nervos
------

nervos.org
They might actually provide data ingestion, *validation* and republication at scale,
making them a viable court registry.


Truthcoin
---------

[Truthcoin](http://truthcoin.info/) (2014-2018) by Paul Sztorc,
once renamed [Hivemind](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/) (2015-2016).
It has ideas both weird and great about smart contracts, oracles, etc.
Warning: Sztorc seems to have the "takes pro-IP arguments seriously problem",
as in "if anyone can copy the data, no useful data will be published",
which is obviously false.


Pumapay
-------

[Pumapay](https://pumapay.io/docs/pumapay_whitepaper.pdf) has a lot of hype around one idea:
making "pull" contracts where suppliers can automatically charge the customer's account.
Beside the dubious security model, the idea is of no help with scaling or simplification.
As described it actually makes for double the number of transactions:
one where the customer creates or authorizes the contract,
then one where the merchant invokes the contract to get money.
The job is much better done on the wallet side, without doing anything special on-chain.
Technically, it seems to be yet another useless shitcoin.
Marketing-wise, they look like they got their shit together.
